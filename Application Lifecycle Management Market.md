<h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Introduction to the Application Lifecycle Management Market</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
Historically, software development processes often relied on fragmented tools and disconnected workflows, leading to inefficiencies, miscommunications, and quality issues. The introduction of Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) aimed to address these challenges by providing a unified platform and integrated approach to managing all phases of an application's life. This shift has been crucial in the modern software landscape, where applications are central to business operations and innovation. ALM ensures traceability from requirements to deployment, facilitates real-time collaboration among stakeholders, and supports iterative development models. It's no longer just about coding, but about effectively managing the entire value stream of software, from conception to continuous delivery and feedback.
