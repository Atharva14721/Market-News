<h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Introduction to the Epoxy Resin Market:</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The Epoxy Resin Market emerged in the mid-20th century and has since become a cornerstone of many industrial
    processes. Epoxy resins are typically formed by the reaction of an epoxide
    "resin" with a polyamine "hardener" or curing agent,
    resulting in a strong, durable, and chemically resistant material. The market
    offers a wide variety of epoxy resin types, each with specific properties
    tailored for different applications. These include diglycidyl ether of
    bisphenol A (DGEBA), which is the most common type, as well as novolac epoxies,
    cycloaliphatic epoxies, and glycidyl ester epoxies, among others. The
    introduction of modified epoxy resins, such as those with improved flexibility,
    toughness, or UV resistance, has further expanded their application scope. The
    Epoxy Resin Market is characterized by continuous innovation in resin
    formulations and curing agents to meet the evolving performance requirements of
    end-use industries and address environmental concerns.
