<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4 pb-2 border-b-2 border-gray-200">Market Analysis Overview</h2>
<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
    The agarose resin market revolves around the production and distribution of specialized chromatography media used primarily for protein purification and separation. Agarose, a natural polysaccharide derived from seaweed, forms the base of these resins, which are designed to offer excellent biocompatibility, high binding capacity, and low non-specific binding. These properties make agarose resins indispensable in biopharmaceutical research, manufacturing, and diagnostic applications. The market is driven by the growing biopharmaceutical industry, the increasing demand for high-purity proteins, and advancements in chromatography techniques.
