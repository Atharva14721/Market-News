<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4 pb-2 border-b-2 border-gray-200">Market Analysis Overview</h2>
<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
    The PSA testing market focuses on diagnostic tests used to measure the level of PSA in a man's blood. Elevated PSA levels can indicate prostate cancer, but can also be caused by other conditions. Therefore, PSA testing is often used in conjunction with other diagnostic methods, such as digital rectal exams (DRE) and biopsies, to diagnose prostate cancer. The market is driven by the high prevalence of prostate cancer, increasing awareness of prostate health, and advancements in testing technologies.
