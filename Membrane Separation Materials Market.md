<li>
<strong>Advancements in membrane materials:</strong> Developments
in polymer science and nanotechnology are leading to the creation of
high-performance membrane materials.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Energy efficiency:</strong> Membrane separation processes
are often more energy-efficient than traditional separation methods,
contributing to their adoption.
</li>
<li>
Membrane separation materials are utilized in
microfiltration processes in water and wastewater plants. The deployment of
membrane separation materials in the above process results in low operating
pressure, cost-effectiveness, and others.
</li>
<li>
The sewage treatment connection rate connected
to wastewater treatment plants is growing at the global level. As a result,
there is a higher adoption of membrane separation in wastewater treatment in
order to ensure separation efficiency.
</li>
<li>
This is fostering the demand for membrane
separation materials to ensure mild operating conditions, which, in turn, is
benefiting the market growth.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Key Restraints:</h2>
<ul class="list-disc text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
<li>
<strong>Fouling and scaling:</strong> Membrane fouling and
scaling can reduce performance and increase maintenance costs.
</li>
<li>
<strong>High initial investment:</strong> The cost of membrane
systems can be a barrier to adoption, especially for small and medium-sized
enterprises.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Limited membrane lifespan:</strong> Membranes have a
finite lifespan and require periodic replacement, increasing operational costs.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Material compatibility:</strong> Ensuring compatibility
between membrane materials and process fluids can be challenging.
</li>
<li>
The overall cost structure of the membrane
separation materials system is primarily determined by the costs of production,
followed by the cost of raw materials.
</li>
<li>
Hence, the above factors are leading to the high
prices of membrane separation materials, which, in turn, is restraining market
growth.
</li>
</ul>
