<h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Active Insulation Market Analysis Overview:</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
The active insulation market focuses on thermal insulation materials and systems that can dynamically adjust their
thermal resistance in response to changing environmental conditions or user
needs. Unlike passive insulation, which provides a fixed level of thermal
resistance, active insulation utilizes technologies like phase change materials
(PCMs), electrochromic materials, or smart ventilation systems to regulate heat
flow. This market is driven by the increasing demand for energy efficiency in
buildings, vehicles, and apparel, as well as the need for enhanced comfort and
performance in various applications.
