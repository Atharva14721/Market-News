<h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Key Restraints:</h2>
<ul class="list-disc text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
    <li>
        <strong>High Initial Investment Costs:</strong> The initial
        investment in purchasing or leasing water taxis, along with the costs of
        maintenance, fuel, and crew, can be significant.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Weather Dependencies:</strong> Water taxi operations can
        be significantly impacted by adverse weather conditions, such as storms, high winds,
        and heavy rain, leading to service disruptions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Regulatory Challenges:</strong> Obtaining necessary
        permits and licenses for water taxi operations can be complex and
        time-consuming, posing a significant barrier to entry for new operators.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Competition from Other Modes of Transport:</strong> Water
        taxis compete with other modes of transportation, such as buses, trains, and
        ride-hailing services, for passenger traffic.
    </li>
    <li>
        Water taxis travel at slower speeds compared to
        other modes of transport, limiting their efficiency to cover long distances.
    </li>
    <li>
        The slower speed increases the overall travel
        time, which makes water taxis less efficient in terms of scheduling and
        customer satisfaction.
    </li>
</ul>
