<h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Key Restraints:</h2>
<ul class="list-disc text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
    <li>
        <strong>Price sensitivity:</strong> The market for generic saline
        solutions can be highly price-sensitive, limiting profit margins.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Intense competition:</strong> Numerous manufacturers
        compete in the market, leading to price competition.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Supply chain vulnerabilities:</strong> Disruptions in the
        supply chain, such as transportation issues or raw material shortages, can
        affect product availability.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Regulatory compliance costs:</strong> Adhering to strict
        regulatory requirements can increase production costs.
    </li>
    <li>
        The production of sodium chloride can have a
        negative impact on the environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        This could lead to stricter environmental
        regulations, which could increase the cost of producing pharmaceutical-grade
        sodium chloride.
    </li>
    <li>
        The production of sodium chloride requires a
        significant amount of water.
    </li>
    <li>
        These waste products can pollute the environment
        if they are not properly disposed of. Hence, due to the high negative impact of
        the production of sodium chloride on the environment, the pharmaceutical grade
        sodium chloride market growth is getting hampered.
