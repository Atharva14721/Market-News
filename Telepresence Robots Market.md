    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
The telepresence robots market
focuses on mobile robotic platforms equipped with cameras, microphones,
speakers, and screens that allow individuals to remotely interact with people
and environments in a distant location. These robots essentially act as a
physical avatar, enabling users to see, hear, speak, and sometimes move within
a remote space. Applications for telepresence robots span various sectors,
including healthcare (remote patient monitoring, virtual consultations),
education (remote learning, virtual field trips), business (remote meetings,
virtual office presence), security (remote patrolling), and personal use
(virtual visits with family). The market is driven by the increasing need for
remote communication and collaboration, advancements in robotics and
communication technologies, and the desire to reduce travel costs and time.
