     <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Introduction to the Automotive 3D Printing Market</h2>
     <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
  Historically, 3D printing in the automotive industry was predominantly used for rapid prototyping, allowing designers and
  engineers to quickly create physical models of new designs for testing and validation. This significantly reduced the time
  and cost associated with product development. However, with advancements in 3D printing technologies, materials, and
  processes, its application has expanded far beyond prototyping. Today, additive manufacturing is being used for producing
  tooling, jigs, fixtures, and increasingly, functional end-use parts. This includes components for both internal combustion
  engine (ICE) vehicles and, notably, a rapidly growing application in electric vehicles (EVs) due to the demand for
  lightweight and performance-optimized parts.
